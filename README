#XML schema to FSM covnerter
This is an experimental script building finite state machines from XML schema files. An interpreter written in C is used to efficiently parse XML documents and to execute actions during traversal.
It is based on the ideas of the Ragel state machine compiler and XML Schema validation based on FSMs as described [here](http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/~ht/XML_Europe_2003.html).
